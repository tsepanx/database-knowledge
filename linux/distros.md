## Linux - the right one

- #### Debian
    You might take a look at *vanilla Debian*, but I didn't spend much time using it,
    **apt** is great, but after all, I prefer **rolling release** scheme

    Anyway, you might like it, as it is most **stable** among popular distributions.

    ##### Other Debian-based, but not exactly Debian
    Since I'm not a big fan of **\*Ubuntu**-based distributions,
    because of their dependence on **Cannonical**, and to be clear,
    for me, it's nothing more than just Debian with a bunch of *useless* apps, I'd rather configure it **myself**.

    But if you're new to GNU/Linux, you might find **Linux Mint** as a great start point
- #### Red Hat, Fedora
    Again, it's depends on big company, which is already red flag, I didn't even tryed it.

    All I know, is they invented their own package manager, package format, but what for?

- #### Gentoo
    This distribution philosophy stands for flexibility, that you can setup it on your own, and take full control of your installed packages

    By default in Gentoo the entire system is built from **source code**, so it will take you a lot of time,
    at least to compile big heavy desktop environment such as **Gnome**, **Kde**, **Xfce**.

    So, you're being forced to use only lightweight, open-source *everything*, from the terminal emulator to your browser.

    Great choise if you're *experienced* enough in terms of Linux, otherwise stick to some else distribution.
- ##### ~~Slackware~~
- #### Arch
    Unlike other distributions, installation process goes only through command line,
    so you have to be skilled enough in *GNU/Linux*, in order to install it.

    Also, it's really nice feature, that helps you understand better 
    how installation process really goes, how Linux really works, and makes your system really *yours*.

    Of course that doesn't belong to some kind of *Graphical installers*, as with them,
    you losing Arch main advantage - configure your computer *like you want*,
    only packages that *you want*, nothing extra, just that you really need.

    ##### Manjaro

    There are a lot of discussions about it, many even call it another, **pacman-based** distribuiton, 
    that doesn't belongs to **Arch** at all, and have it's own issues and own community.

    I think it is great option as **first distribution** comparing with many *Ubuntu* distributions,
    also, those, who intend to **play** on Linux, might, find it great, ready to start solution.
