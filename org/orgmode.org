I made it mainly for myself, to reproduce any step if I forgot it.

Official docs are available at https://orgmode.org/guide.

* Introduction
I found org mode very useful, especially for taking notes, or whatsoever.
Seems to be complete replacement of markdown for me.

* Document structure
** Cycling between headings (Motion)
| C-c C-n | Next heading                     |
| C-c C-p | Previous heading                 |
| C-c C-f | Next heading same level          |
| C-c C-b | Previous heading same level      |
| C-c C-u | Backward to higher level heading |

** Moving headers (Structure Editing)
| M-RET               | Insert new heading with same level as current                              |
| M-S-RET             | Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.                  |
| M-LEFT/RIGHT or H/L | Promote or demote current heading by one level.                            |
| M-UP/DOWN or J/K    | Move subtree up or down, swap with previous or next subtree of same level. |

** Search in headers (Sparse Trees)
| C-c /   | Prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating command |
| C-c / r | Search by regexp (Normal usage)                                   |

** Plain lists
- One
- [ ] Two
- [ ] Three
  - Another level
    - 33333

| M-RET   | Insert new item at current level                                                                        |
| M-S-RET | Insert a new item with a checkbox                                                                       |
| C-c C-c | If there is a checkbox, toggle. Also verify bullets and indentation consistency in the whole list.      |
| C-c -   | Cycle the entire list level through the different itemize/enumerate bullets (‘-’, ‘+’, ‘*’, ‘1.’, ‘1)’) |

* Tables
C-c | Convert the active region to table.
** Column and row editing

| M-LEFT/RIGHT | Move the current column left/right.                                                                             |
| M-S-LEFT     | Kill the current column.                                                                                        |
| M-S-RIGHT    | Insert a new column to the left of point position.                                                              |
| M-UP/DOWN    | Move the current row up/down.                                                                                   |
| M-S-UP       | Kill the current row or horizontal line.                                                                        |
| M-S-DOWN     | Insert a new row above the current row. With a prefix argument, the line is created below the current one.      |
| C-c -        | Insert a horizontal line below current row. With a prefix argument, the line is created above the current line. |
| C-c RET      | Insert a horizontal line below current row, and move the point into the row below that line.                    |
| C-c ^        | Sort the table lines in the region. The position of point indicates the column to be used for sorting           |
* Hyperlinks

~[[LINK][DESCRIPTION]]~

[[https://archlinux.org][Archlinux website]]

| C-c C-l                    | Insert a link. This prompts for a link to be inserted into the buffer                                     |
| C-c C-l (on existing link) | When point is on an existing link, C-c C-l allows you to edit the link and description parts of the link. |

* TODO Items
** Basic TODO Functionality
| C-c C-t      | Change the TODO state of the current item                              |
| C-c / t      | View TODO items in a sparse tree (see [[file:~/org/orgmode.org::*Search in headers (Sparse Trees)][Search in headers (Sparse Trees)]] |
| S-RIGHT/LEFT | Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.         |
| S-M-RET      | Insert a new TODO entry below the current one                          |

* Timestamps
| C-c . | Add a new timestamp |

* Other Test Footers
** My table

| AAA      | Hiii |
| --       | ---  |
| NNNNNNNN | DDDD |
|          |      |

Outlining
Headlines and folding make structured editing a breeze. Plain text makes it easy to sync and version control Org files.
